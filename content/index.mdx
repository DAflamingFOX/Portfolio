## About me

I like to call myself a jack of *some* trades, or a proficiently dedicated dabbler.

My main focus right now is being a student at Tarleton State University, pursuing an Bachelor's degree in **Electrical Engineering**, with a minor in Computer Science.

I enjoy the E.E. / C.S. field so much that I currently I do some freelance work as a "junior electrical engineer," primarly creating custom **32-bit microcontrollers PCBs** for various purposes.
I also enjoy **writing firmware** for the aforementioned PCBs in **C & C++**, along with various other projects in **C, C++, Dart / Flutter, & Java**.

On a more personal note, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, playing with my dog, Maisey, playing tennis & pickleball, drawing, graphics design, and even linedancing!
