# Portfolio

## CANnect

I co-developed "CANnect," a custom PCB which combines 2 CAN buses and 2 pairs of power wires over generic twisted pair cabling, in order to simplify the wiring of FRC robots.
CANnect is available for purchase [here.](https://swyftrobotics.com/products/swyft-cannect-wiring-system)

I've also written comprehensive documetnation for the user of CANnect [here.](https://docs.swyftrobotics.com/electronics/swyft-cannect)

## Ranger

I created "Ranger," a custom PCB for a LIDAR sensor, delivering both analog and digital outputs to simplify the use of the device.
Ranger is available for purchase [here.](https://swyftrobotics.com/products/swyft-ranger-distance-sensor)

I've also written comprehensive documentation for the use of Ranger [here.](https://docs.swyftrobotics.com/electronics/swyft-ranger)

## Spring & point-mass physics simulation

A take-home lab from my differential equations class.
The goal was to find physics constants (point-mass, drag coefficient, gravity, spring constant, natural length, etc.)
to produce a stable pyramid built with 3 point-masses all interconnected with springs.

## Motor stall detection via current monitoring

Simulated a DC Motor and its current draw in order to describe how a stall can be detected.
I also wrote up a comprehensive analysis of the simulation on Tigerbotics' website [here.](https://www.tigerbotics.org/programming/current-monitoring)
